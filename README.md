Basic D3 demo

This is a very basic demo using the popular D3 charting library. 

Built using the Angular framework.

Based on http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/d3-on-angular.html

Note I've included a test directory. As this is a basic build I've stripped things back but left the test directory so we can continue tdd going forwards.

Installation: Just clone this repo. There is no need to run npm install, I've included everything in the repo.
